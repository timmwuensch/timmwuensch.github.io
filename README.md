# Machine Learning
Machine Learning in general is the ability of computer systems to learn patterns and to generalize data. Based on this patterns it is possible to make decisions and forecast future behavior for unknown data.

Infact Machnine Learning is a collection of various statistical and mathemetical methods to recognize patterns in a dataset. 

Here we differ between three types of Machine Learning problems, based on their learning method (suppervised or unsupervised) and the intention of the Machine Learning system.

Classification is a type of problem where the system predicts **discrete outputs**, like a certain number of classes. Based on its Supervised Learning strategy, the input data has to be pre-labeled.

Regression is a type of problem where the system predicts **continuous outputs**, like a certain value of interest. The input data has to be labeles as well, that means it requires a record of data including the value. A common example is the prediction of temperature on the basis of collected weather data.

Clustering is a type of problem where the system finds **unknown patterns and groups** in a dataset. It is a kind of explorative data analysis. A common example is categorization of fitting sizes into groups like small, medium, large or extra large.
